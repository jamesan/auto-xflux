auto-xflux
==========

Inputless xflux daemon that geocodes based on your external IP address.

This requires working systemd instance and X server for the user executing xflux. It requires an
Internet connection to already be established and assumes that the following services are online:

- [icanhazip.com]
- [geocodeip.com]

This also obviously requires [xflux](https://justgetflux.com/linux.html) (to be accessible in $PATH).
